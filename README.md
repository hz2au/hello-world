# hello-world

Hello GitHub,

Novice here, diving into the developer world and currently revisiting HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the like. 
I've some previous experience with HTML, C++, and Ladder Logic, but it's been quite a few years - so bear with me.

Looking forward to getting started with GitHub and hoping that it will be helpful on my path to developing as a coder!
